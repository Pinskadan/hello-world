# hello-world

People of Earth!

My name is Gibson Wirth, and I've been specifically recommended to use this repository as a storage place
for whatever whimsical projects I decide to work on in order to flex my programming and other computer 
science-y projects.

Anyone who wishes to pour over my stuff is encouraged to do so; I'm eager to learn, and I don't bite.
